## Heart-Disease-Prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction program uses the Decision Tree Algorithm to detect heart disease more quickly

## What the Problem?
Cleveland Hospital has a dataset related to heart disease that has sufficient data. Here the hospital wants to know a way to detect heart disease more quickly. Among the alternative solutions developed is the Data Science method which applies a framework that has been widely used in the industrial world, namely the CRISP-DM framework. This framework is further broken down into a sequence of 11 steps, including: understanding business goals, understanding technical data science goals, understanding and carrying out initial data processing, creating modeling scenarios, creating reliable models, evaluating modeling, and reviewing data science projects. This solution is used to identify factors that contribute to the accurate detection of heart disease

The main data source for developing this predictive model is the results of medical records. There are 14 attributes with the last attribute (num) being the label you are looking for.

The main aim of using Data Science methods in this case is to produce an accurate predictive model that can be used to: (1) identify key variables that influence heart disease, and (2) predict heart disease. It is hoped that the results of predictive modeling using Data Science can provide input to hospitals in detecting heart disease better.
